How do we protect your information?

When you enter, submit or access your personal information, we take various security measures to maintain the security of your personal information.

How to disclose your information?
We may use your information to better serve you only for the following purposes:

A. Personal information. Generally, we use session and usage data internally to serve our users and enable them to make the most of applications, services, and sites. We do not store personal information, so we do not disclose your personal information.
B. Non-personal information. We may disclose non-personal information to our trusted partners who should abide by this privacy policy and relevant privacy laws. We do not combine non-personal information with personal information (for example, combining your name with a unique user device number).

Do we use cookies?

We do not use cookies.

Do we disclose any information to other parties?

We will not sell, trade or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to external parties. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating the website, conducting business, or providing services to you, as long as these third parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also publish your information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our website policies or protect our or others' rights, property, or security. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising or other purposes.

Third-party websites

The service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to the site. Please note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you read the privacy policies of these sites. I have no control over the content, privacy policy or behavior of any third-party sites or services, nor do I take any responsibility.

Children's privacy

These services are not intended for anyone under the age of 13. I will not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If I find out that a child under the age of 13 provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete that information from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and know that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I can take the necessary action.

Safety

I value your trust in providing us with your personal information, so we are working hard to protect it using commercially acceptable methods. But keep in mind that neither the method of transmission over the Internet nor the method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
